![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/API-19%2B-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)

Since multiple apps can play audio to the sample ouptut stream simultaneously, it is requred to handle AudioFocus correctly.

However you do not want to call or set an alerm just to see if your impletemtation is working as you expected. 

AudioThief gain AudioFocus from your app and release it back.

## Usage

#### 1. Add AudioThief dependency

```groovy

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.takusemba:audiothief:x.x.x'
}

```

#### 2. Edit your manifest.xml

```xml

<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
  <!--this permission is required if your app targets Android 9.0 (API level 28)-->
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>

  <application>
  <!--...-->
    <service
       android:name="com.takusemba.audiothief.AudioFocusGainService"
       android:exported="true"
       />
  </application>
       
</manifest>

```

#### 3. Gain and Release AudioFocus

You can start a foreground service that gains AudioFocus via adb command, or simply start the srevice inside your app.

```bash
adb shell am startservice --ei AUDIO_REQUEST_KEY [audioRequestKey] your.package.name/com.takusemba.audiothief.AudioFocusGainService
```

It holds AudioFocus until the foreground service stops.

```
adb shell am stopservice --ei AUDIO_REQUEST_KEY [audioRequestKey] your.package.name/com.takusemba.audiothief.AudioFocusGainService
```

## AudioRequestKey

AudioRequestKey defines how you gain AudioFocus. That would be Int of 1, 2, 3, or 4.

| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
